    <h2>Phillip Illguth</h2>
    <p>Hi Class, I'm Phillip Illguth and I am currently married
        and have been for about a year and a half.
        We currently have a dog named Islay. I currently work at the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office as a control room operator inside the jail.
        I am working on my Associate's degree in applied technology. I love to play video games and spend time with my family.
        The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is being able to involve Heavenly Father in my studies more than I would at a regular university.
        I currently live in Fruit Hegihts Utah.
        I'm currently in the carreer that I want, so I am going to get this degree, so I can show I went to college.</p>
